        The form found above this text aims to calculate if there is seasonality in the time series. 
        seasonality indicated that the time-series repeats itself somehow
        All statistical seasonality functions calculate how likely it is that the seasonality is present due to some random process. 
        This likelihood is expressed as a percentage called the p-value. 
        For example, if the p-value is 10%, then there is a 10% chance that the seasonality observed in the time series is due to randomness
        Normally in statistical test we define two hypotheses. Hypotheses 0 is that there is no seasonality in the time series while Hypotheses 1 is that there is seasonality in the time-series.

     <p>This web application is built to help people understand time series data. 
        All functions in this web application work with CSV files that include a time column named "Date." 
        Be aware that all functions will not work unless the data is provided in this format.</p>

        Click on the 'Display ts' button to plot your data. 
        On this page, you can also find a link to the page that shows all the images you have created. 
        On the calculation page, you can analyze the trend and seasonality of your dataset and examine the behavior of the residuals after removing the trend or seasonality.
